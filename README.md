# Guess Number- User

## In the second version of the game, where the computer guesses our number. We continuously feed the computer a lower and upper bound, until the computer has figured out our number or randomly guessed it correctly. We do this by gathering user input from terminal and telling the computer whether its guess is too high, low, or correct.
